<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Analysis on Inflation</h1>

</div>


<div id="background" class="section level1">
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>We currently live in a special time in history. While we are still dealing with an ongoing global pandemic, the economy is also faced with high inflation. High inflation often leads to higher cost of living and decreased living standard.</p>
<p>This project aims to answer how inflation is tied to an economy and the economic growth, and how one may predict the future inflation given current state of the economy. In particular, the following questions will be answered</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How does inflation affect the overall economy and economic growth (e.g. GDP)?</li>
<li>How does inflation affect the standard of living i.e. CPI?</li>
<li>Given the current state of the economy, how may one predict the future inflation?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<div id="data-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>The main source of data is from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/">OECD</a>). Data from OECD are downloaded as annual data in CSV files and includes the following information.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Stock data are mainly extracted from <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha Vantage</a> and <a href="https://finnhub.io/">Finnhub</a>.</p>
<p>The API for Alpha Vantage and Finnhub are only available in Python and other non-R languages, and therefore the data is extracted in the code <a href="https://hgeorge21.github.io/JSC370-finalproject/data_download.py">here</a></p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>Overall, the main tools used for the project are R and Python.</p>
<p>Python is focused towards data collection from Finnhub and Alpha Vantage for market, mainly major indices (DJIA, NASAQ, and S&amp;P500) with sector ETFs.</p>
<p>R is used for the data cleaning, analytics, and constructing interactive plots</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tidylr</code> for piping</li>
<li><code>dplyr</code> for table manipulations</li>
<li><code>data.tables</code> for more table manipulations</li>
<li><code>ggplot</code> and <code>plotly</code> for visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>Once data is read in from CSV to dataframe (one file per metric), they are filtered to contain only the information described above. Then they are all merged using <code>merge</code> based on country code and year. From here, any NA are dropped.</p>
<p>For the prediction problem, the target is next year’s inflation number for each country. This data is first extracted from consolidated data to update the year and then merged back as target. Finally, the train and test data are split in 70% and 30%, respectively, in chronological order i.e. the test data occurs strictly after the training data by country.</p>
