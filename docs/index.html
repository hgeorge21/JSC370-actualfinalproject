<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Analysis on Inflation</h1>

</div>


<div id="background" class="section level1">
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>We currently live in a special time in history. While we are still dealing with an ongoing global pandemic, the economy is also faced with high inflation. High inflation often leads to higher cost of living and decreased living standard.</p>
<p>This project aims to answer how inflation is tied to an economy and the economic growth, and how one may predict the future inflation given current state of the economy. In particular, the following questions will be answered</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How does inflation affect the overall economy and economic growth (e.g. GDP)?</li>
<li>How does inflation affect the standard of living i.e. CPI?</li>
<li>Given the current state of the economy, how may one predict the future inflation?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="methods" class="section level1">
<h1>Methods</h1>
<div id="data-source" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>The main source of data is from Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (<a href="https://www.oecd.org/">OECD</a>). Data from OECD are downloaded as annual data in CSV files and includes the following information.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Stock data are mainly extracted from <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha Vantage</a> and <a href="https://finnhub.io/">Finnhub</a>.</p>
<p>The API for Alpha Vantage and Finnhub are only available in Python and other non-R languages, and therefore the data is extracted in the code <a href="https://hgeorge21.github.io/JSC370-finalproject/data_download.py">here</a></p>
</div>
<div id="data-cleaning" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>Overall, the main tools used for the project are R and Python.</p>
<p>Python is focused towards data collection from Finnhub and Alpha Vantage for market, mainly major indices (DJIA, NASAQ, and S&amp;P500) with sector ETFs.</p>
<p>R is used for the data cleaning, analytics, and constructing interactive plots</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tidylr</code> for piping</li>
<li><code>dplyr</code> for table manipulations</li>
<li><code>data.tables</code> for more table manipulations</li>
<li><code>ggplot</code> and <code>plotly</code> for visualization</li>
</ul>
<p>Once data is read in from CSV to dataframe (one file per metric), they are filtered to contain only the information described above. Then they are all merged using <code>merge</code> based on country code and year. From here, any NA are dropped.</p>
<p>For the prediction problem, the target is next year’s inflation number for each country. This data is first extracted from consolidated data to update the year and then merged back as target. Finally, the train and test data are split in 70% and 30%, respectively, in chronological order i.e. the test data occurs strictly after the training data by country.</p>

<h2>Prediction of Next Year’s Inflation</h2>
<p>In order to build a model that predicts each country’s inflation for the following year given current state of the economy, all the features that we have in the data are used, including current year’s inflation number. The models that are used are</p>
<ul>
<li>Pruned Decision Tree</li>
<li>Bagging</li>
<li>Random Forest</li>
<li>GBM</li>
<li>XGBoost</li>

<h3 class="tabset">Variable Importance</h3>
<p>We can see from the variable importance plots that boosting does not quite align with other models. For instance, GDP growth is not as important in other models whereas it is second most important in boosting model. This is a crucial distinction as seen from the models’ performances.</p>

<p>The following graph shows the performance of the XGBoost by plotting the predicted inflation rate against the actual inflation rate. The red line is the 45-degree line which indicates the case of perfect prediction where all points should lie on the line. From the graph, we can see there is a linear relationship between the predicted and actual inflation. The implication is that the XGBoost model is capable to predict future inflation to some extent. This is important because it can help policy makers to better understand the future state of economy and adjust policies accordingly. <img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
