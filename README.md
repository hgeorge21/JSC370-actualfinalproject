# JSC370 Final Project -- Analysis on Inflation

This project is about examining inflation and how to predict future inflation.

All the data used are extracted from OECD, check details in website. The economic indicator data are all in the folder `data`. All the CSVs were downloaded manually (sorry...) and cleaned by running the file `./resource/datacleaning.R`.

Simply running `index.Rmd` and `./resource/report.Rmd` will generate the `index.html` for the site and `report.pdf` for the PDF report.

The video for presentation is linked at https://play.library.utoronto.ca/watch/1a4491307b9907a70ab31cadf3019f24

The website is hosted on https://hgeorge21.github.io/JSC370-inflationAnalysis/

Have fun and hope you learn something :)
