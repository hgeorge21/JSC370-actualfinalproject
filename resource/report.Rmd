# Introduction
We currently live in a special time in history. While we are still dealing with an ongoing global pandemic,
the economy is also faced with high inflation. High inflation often leads to higher cost of living and decreased
living standard. 

This project aims to answer how inflation is tied to an economy and the economic growth, and how one may predict the future inflation given current state of the economy.
In particular, the following questions will be answered

1. How does inflation affect the overall economy and economic growth (e.g. GDP)?
2. How does inflation affect the standard of living i.e. CPI?
3. Given the current state of the economy, how may one predict the future inflation?
